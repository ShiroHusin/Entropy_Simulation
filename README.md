## About
Entropy is a fascinating concept in physics. The idea of quantifying the number of configurations that a system can occupy is a powerful idea with huge impact within the fields of mathematics, computer science and computational biology. 

In this project, I was inspired by the use of Cellular Automata (CA) to model a stochastic process. The main source code is labelled Automata.py

As with any cellular automata project, the rules of the simulation needs to be established. For a more comprehensive explaination of the rules please see [here].

For more details on the calculation of entropy, please see [here].

Examples of the simulations can be shown below in some of GiFs.
