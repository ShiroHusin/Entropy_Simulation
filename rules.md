The goal of the problem is to model a random process.

The rules of the problem are:
- A cell within the 2D grid can only take 2 discrete values 1 or 0.

- The number of cells within the grid cannot change. This is an analogue of the 1st law of thermodynamics. 

- An occupied cell (1) can move in a random direction to an empty cell (0) that is 1 unit away. 
     -This means that a 1 surrounded by empty cells has 9 possible outcomes or microstates either it can go up, down, left, right, any of the 4 diagonals or do nothing.
